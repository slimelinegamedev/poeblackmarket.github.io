{"name":"Blackmarket","tagline":"The exiles' ultimate way to find the best items in wraeclast.","body":"\r\nBlackmarket is a Path Of Exile trade search tool that allows you to search what you want in easiest possible way. 100% free, ad-free and open source. Powered by [Exile Tools Indexer Public API](http://api.exiletools.com/info/indexer.html), Blackmarket allows you to manually build your Elastic JSON Queries; making Blackmarket the most powerful search tool available for PoE.\r\n\r\n### Screenshot\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/75921/10564609/01f33a54-75ed-11e5-806a-886c209d2d34.PNG)\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n1. Auto notification of items. E.g. Get a sound notification when 5c Tabula Rasa is posted. Any other item/s can be searched as well. This feature is called Durian Mode (name taken from previous project I have).\r\n\r\n2. Easy to use Search Form: you got fields for pseudo life, so instead of manually entering \"(pseudo) (total) +# to maximum Life\", all you need to do is to enter 50 on the min (or max). The same is true for Fire/Cold/Light/Chaos/Total Res and Str/Int/Dex Attributes.\r\n\r\n3. Advance Mode - this mode grants you Power Overwhelming search queries. See this [reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/3p8gme/blackmarket_05_online_only_durian_mode_improved/cw445eh) and my reply for an example.\r\n\r\n4. WTB tracker - if you clicked on WTB, it gets recorded how many times. As well as a change in color in the UI - this is all to help you remember which item have you PM'ed or not.\r\n\r\n5. More accurate Online status. Blackmarket is dead accurate on Online status of players - see my [reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/3p8gme/blackmarket_05_online_only_durian_mode_improved/cw4hmt4) where I've tested it.\r\n\r\n6. Ad free! Loading ads takes a lot of badwidth that's needed for Lockstep. Note that these annoying ads also reload whenever they want!\r\n\r\n7. And a lot of small quality of life features.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n1. Due to the current limitation of the PoE forum bumping issue, Blackmarket's support for Permanent Standard and Hardcore is limited. See this reddit comment as well.\r\n\r\n2. Clunky auto complete combobox on imp/expicit mods, will improve this over time.\r\n\r\n3. Normalize Quality - no option yet to factor-in quality when calculating DPS or Armour/Ev/Es\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nCheck the Releases page on github: [https://github.com/thirdy/blackmarket/releases](https://github.com/thirdy/blackmarket/releases)\r\n\r\nStarting version 0.6, Blackmarket now includes an auto-update feature.\r\n\r\n### An important note on Open Source\r\n\r\nBlackmarket is 100% free and fully open source under GPLv2. In a nutshell, this means that Blackmarket will always be free, and anyone can take the source code and modify it for improvements. However, this will also require that all the released modified versions be free software as well.\r\n\r\nRead more about open source here. The GNU GPLv2 [FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.en.html) page is also a good read.\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/75921/10564600/ba2a9a78-75ec-11e5-8c83-2bf913272d67.PNG)\r\n\r\n### Suggestions or Issues?\r\n\r\nFeel free to post your feedback/suggestions/bugs to either:\r\n\r\n1.
